# QuizPoint

QuizPoint is a education platform that allows schools to test and educate students on relevant topics that they need testing on.
This platform then selfmarks the quizzes, and can generate reports for teachers that are easy to use and read.

In our use case, we used this project in our school's technology department to solve the need to assess
students on their ability to safely perform tasks in a workshop. This program allows teachers to assign
quizzes and setup a class, from there the program will self mark the students results, and display it in a 
easy to read format, allowing teachers extra time for other things!

## Features

- Self Marking ability
- Intergration with Google Sign In and Office365 (on its way)
- A Mobile Application that allows students to use their camera to upload images (if required by quiz)
- Auto saves progress everywhere when applicable (e.g when creating quiz, when changing settings, etc)
- Generates and exports reports in PDF and .xslx (spreadsheet).
- Sends email notifications to users (when applicable)
